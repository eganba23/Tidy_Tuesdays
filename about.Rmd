My name is Benjamin Egan. As I mentioned, this website serves as a collection of assignments I created for Wake Forest University's course on [Data Science for Psychologists](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/). If you want a full list of my work, please check out [my github page](https://github.com/eganba23), as it can provide you with more up to date projects.
